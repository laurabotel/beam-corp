## Usage
1. Copy your PostgreSQL database URI into [beamql.com](www.beamql.com).
2. View and interact with the graphical visualization of the database and use it in API documentation to give users a better understanding of what they are working with.
3. Open NodeJS backend codebase in a code editor.
4. Use the schema and resolvers that BeamQL produces with [Apollo Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apollo-server-express) or a similar GraphQL server that suits your Node.js server.
5. Start server and navigate to localhost:X000/graphql
6. Behold the glory of your database accessible through the query language of the future!


## To Do
- Convert to typescript
- Add support for all PostgreSQL data types
- Integrate GraphiQL so user's can test their endpoints with the generated schema and resolvers
